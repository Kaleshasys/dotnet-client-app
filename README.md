Steps to Deploy a .NET Web Application to Azure using Terraform and GitHub Actions

1. Create the .NET Sample Web Application

    * Develop the .NET sample web application on your local machine.
    * Perform a local build and publish the web application, running it on localhost to ensure everything is working correctly.

2. Provision an Azure Web App using Terraform

    * Use a Terraform script to create an Azure Web App.
    * Authenticate using a service principal with contributor access at the subscription level to provision resources securely.

3. Download the Publish Profile

    * After the Azure Web App is created via Terraform, go to the Deployment Center menu in the Azure portal.
    * Download the Manage Publish Profile. This will be used later for deployment.

4. Create a GitHub Repository and Set Up Secrets

    * Create a public repository on GitHub for your project.
    * Add a repository secret in GitHub to store the Manage Publish Profile. This will facilitate communication between GitHub Actions and the Azure Web App.

5. Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

    * In your GitHub repository, create a .github/workflow directory.
    * Add a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file in this directory to automate the deployment process.

6. Configure the Pipeline

    * The pipeline should consist of two jobs:
    * Build Job: Build and publish the .NET application code as an artifact.
    * Deploy Job: Download the artifact and deploy the .NET application code to the Azure Web App.

7. Access the Deployed Web Application

    * Once the deployment is complete, you can access your web application using the Azure Web App URL.
